the simplest object is the identity
an identity asserts only existence

the next simplest object is interaction
an interaction asserts an arbitrary connection between identities

consider a some multitude of identities, connected by interactions
this multitude can be identified as an object

so all objects can be understood in two layers
	what are the constituent objects and interactions that this object is identified with
	what are the macro objects of which this object is a part, and how does this object interact with other particular objects

so to understand all objects, understand the most basic identities that appear in nearly all contexts
	the most basic objects
	the interactions that can exist between them
